  <title>Curvature conditions and hyperbolicity of the geodesic flow</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Many results about geodesics and the geodesic flow assume that all sectional curvatures are negative or one of the following increasingly weaker properties:
      <ol>
        <li>all sectional curvatures are non-positive,</li>
        <li>no focal points,</li>
        <li>no conjugate points.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      These properties can be characterized by the behaviour of Jacobi fields:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Negative curvature:
          the length of any (non-trivial) Jacobi field orthogonal to a geodesic is a strictly convex function.
        </li>
        <li>
          Non-positive curvature:
          the length of any Jacobi field is a convex function.
        </li>
        <li>
          No focal points:
          the length of an initially vanishing Jacobi field is a non-decreasing function along a geodesic ray.
        </li>
        <li>
          No conjugate points:
          a (non-trivial) Jacobi field can vanish at most once.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      The no focal point property is equivalent to convexity of spheres in the universal cover.
      Most interesting results about manifolds with non-positive curvature extend readily to manifolds with no focal points.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a compact manifold,
      negative curvature implies that the geodesic flow is uniformly hyperbolic,
      in other words an Anosov flow.
      This means that there is a <m>D\phi_t</m>-invariant splitting of the tangent bundle of the unit tangent bundle <m>SM</m>,
      <me>
        TSM = E^s \oplus E^0 \oplus E^u
      </me>,
      in which <m>E^0</m> is the one dimensional subbundle tangent to the orbits of the geodesic flow,
      and there are constants <m>C \geq 1</m> and
      <m>\lambda > 0</m> such that for any <m>t \geq 0</m> and any vectors
      <m>\xi \in E^s</m> and <m>\eta \in E^u</m> we have
      <men xml:id="hyp">
        \|D\phi_t(\xi)\| \leq Ce^{-\lambda t}\|\xi\| \text{ and } \|D\phi_{-t}(\eta)\| \leq Ce^{-\lambda t}\|\eta\|
      </men>.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Here we have in mind the usual Sasaki metric;
      the same property would also hold for any equivalent metric with different constants <m>C</m> and <m>\lambda</m>.) This splitting is H\"older-continuous,
      but usually not smooth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bundles <m>E^s</m> and <m>E^u</m> for an Anosov geodesic flow are integrable;
      their integral foliations are usually denoted by <m>W^s</m> and <m>W^u</m>.
      The lifts to the universal cover of the leaves of <m>W^s</m> and <m>W^u</m> are closely related to horospheres.
      If <m>\widetilde v</m> is the lift to <m>S\widetilde M</m> of <m>v \in SM</m>,
      the lifts to <m>S\widetilde M</m> of <m>W^s(v)</m> and <m>W^u(v)</m> are formed by the unit vectors that are normal to the appropriate horospheres orthogonal to
      <m>\widetilde v</m> and are on the same side of the horosphere as <m>\widetilde v</m>;
      see the picture below.

      That Anosov geodesic flow implies no conjugate points is proved in part B of \cite{Mane1987}.
    </p>
    <p>
      The class of compact manifolds that support metrics with variable negative curvature is much larger than the class that support hyperbolic metrics
      (of constant negative curvature).
      The earliest examples of manifolds that support variable but not constant negative curvature were given by Mostow-Siu \cite{Mos-Siu1980} and Gromov-Thurston \cite{Gro-Thu1987}. Recent work of Ontaneda has vastly increased the supply of examples \cite{Ontaneda2011, Ontaneda2014}.

    <openconjecture>
      <title>Klingenberg</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If a closed manifold admits a metric with Anosov geodesic flow,
          then it admits a metric with negative sectional curvature.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <status>
        <p>
          All known examples of metrics with Anosov geodesic flow are perturbations of metrics with negative curvature.
          It is not difficult to show using the uniformization theorem and the Thurston geometerization theorem that conjecture is true in dimensions 2 and 3.
          Klingenberg \cite{Klingenberg1974} showed that seven properties of Riemannian manifolds with negative curvature extend to those with Anosov geodesic flow.
          One of these is Preissman's theorem \cite{Preissman1943} that the fundamental group of a manifold with negative sectional curvatures cannot contain a copy of <m>{\mathbb Z} \times {\mathbb Z}</m>.
        </p>
      </status>
      <context>
        <p>
          Several examples of manifolds that admit metrics of non-positive curvature but cannot support a metric of negative curvature
          (or with Anosov geodesic flow)
          can be found in the introduction to \cite{Ba-Br-Eb1985}. These examples have a copy of
          <m>{\mathbb Z} \times {\mathbb Z}</m> in their fundamental group.
          The simplest of them is due to Heintze who took two cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds,
          cut off the cusps,
          glued the two pieces together along their boundary tori and then smoothed out the metric to obtain a manifold with non-positive curvature.

    <openquestion>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>(M,g)</m> has no conjugate points,
          does <m>M</m> carry a metric with non-positive sectional curvature?
        </p>
      </statement>
    </openquestion>
    <openquestion>
      <preamble>
        <p>
          Again it is not difficult to use the uniformization theorem to show that the answer is affirmative in dimension 2.
          But the problem is still open even in dimension 3.
          See \cite{Cro-Sch1986}, \cite{Lebedeva2002} and \cite{Iva-Kap2014} for results of the nature that the fundamental groups of manifolds with no conjugate points share properties with those of non-positive curvature.
          Section 8 of \cite{Iva-Kap2014} contains a number of open problems of which we mention:
        </p>
      </preamble>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Is the fundamental group of a closed manifold without conjugate points semihyperbolic?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <discussion>
        <p>
          Semihyperbolicity is a condition introduced by Alonso and Bridson \cite{Alo-Bri1995} to describe non-positive curvature in the large for an arbitrary metric space.

          The geodesic flow is partially hyperbolic if there are a <m>D\phi_t</m>-invariant splitting
          <me>
            TSM = E^s \oplus E^c \oplus E^u
          </me>
          and constants <m>C \geq 1</m> and
          <m>\lambda > \mu > 0</m> such that <xref ref="hyp"/> holds and in addition for all <m>t</m> and all <m>\zeta \in E^c</m> we have
          <me>
            C^{-1}e^{-\mu|t|}\|\zeta\| \leq \|D\phi_t(\zeta)\| \leq Ce^{\mu|t|}\|\zeta\|
          </me>.
        </p>
      </discussion>

        <p>
          Anosov geodesic flows are degenerate examples of partially hyperbolic geodesic flows.
          Genuine examples
          (with <m>\dim E^c \geq 2</m>)
          have been constructed by Carneiro and Pujals;
          see \cite{Car-Puj2011} and \cite{Car-Puj2013}. They deformed a higher rank locally symmetric space of non-compact type.
          This answered a question raised by Herman in emails to many dynamicists.
