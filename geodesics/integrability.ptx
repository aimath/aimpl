    <title>Metrics  with integrable geodesic flow on surfaces of genus <m>\ge 2</m></title>
    <openquestion>
      <title>Bangert</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Does there exist a Riemannian metric on a closed surface of genus <m>\ge 2</m> whose geodesic flow is completely integrable?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <context>
        <p>
          The answer may depend on the smoothness of the metric and on what we understand by ``completely integrable'': whether the integral is functionally independent of the Hamiltonian on an open everywhere dense subset,
          or we additionally assume that the subset has full measure.

          Ma\~n\'e showed that a Hamiltonian flow on surfaces is generically Anosov or has zero Liouville exponents<nbsp/><xref ref="Mane1996"/>.
          This suggests that an easier version of the above question would be the following

          Is there a Riemannian metric on a closed surface of genus <m>\ge 2</m> whose geodesic flow has zero Liouville entropy?

          Bangert and Paternain have outlined some ideas about what a Finsler metric with this property might look like;
          finding a Riemannian metric is certainly harder.
        </p>
        <p>
          A special case of the Finsler version of the question above would be:

          Let <m>F_1</m>,
          <m>F_2</m> be Finsler metrics on a closed surface of genus <m>\ge 2</m>.
          Assume every (unparameterized) <m>F_1</m>-geodesic is an <m>F_2</m>-geodesic.
          Must <m>F_1</m> be obtained from <m>F_2</m> by multiplication by a constant and adding a closed form?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <context>
        <p>
          One can also ask this question for arbitrary closed manifolds that can carry a hyperbolic metric
          (if <m>F_1</m>, <m>F_2</m> are Riemannian,
          the answer is affirmative<nbsp/><xref ref="Matveev2003a"/>).
        </p>
        <p>
          The previous question is related to the other questions in this section because of the following observation from<nbsp/><xref ref="Mat-Top1998"/>:
          one can use the second metric to construct an integral of the geodesic flow of the first one.
          If both metrics are Riemannian,
          the integral is quadratic in velocities and the affirmative answer follows from<nbsp/><xref ref="Kolokoltsov1983"/>;

          Does there exist a non-Riemannian Finsler metric satisfying the Landsberg condition on a surface of genus <m>\ge 2</m>?

      <discussion>
        <p>
          The Landsberg condition is defined in<nbsp/><xref ref="Bao2007"/>.
          It implies the existence of an integral for the geodesic flow of the metric,
          which is the relation of this question with the present section.
          See<nbsp/><xref ref="Gom-Rug2013"/> for a negative answer to the question assuming non-existence of conjugate points.
          Note that the natural analog of <xref ref="question_landsberg">Question</xref>
          is completely open in all settings:
          locally, globally, in all dimensions,
          and is one of the most important problems in the Finsler geometry, see e.g.

    <title>Integrable geodesic flows with integrals of higher degree</title>
    <openconjecture>
      <title>\cite{Bo-Ko-Fo1995}</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If the geodesic flow of a Riemannian metric on the torus <m>T^2</m> admits an integral that is polynomial of degree 3 in the velocities,
          then the metric admits a Killing vector field.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <discussion>
        <p>
          A Killing vector field <m>V</m> allows us to construct an integral
          <me>
            I:TM \to \Real, \ I(\xi):=g(V, \xi)
          </me>
          that is evidently linear in velocities;
          its third power is then an integral cubic in velocities.
        </p>
        <p>
          The motivation to study metrics admitting integrals polynomial in velocities comes from the following observation (which dates back at least to Darboux and Whittaker):
          if the geodesic flow admits an integral that is analytic in velocities,
          then each component of this integral that is homogeneous in velocities is also an integral.
          The natural idea is then to study the integrals that are polynomial in velocities of low degree.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the result of Kolokoltsov<nbsp/><xref ref="Kolokoltsov1983"/>,
          no metric on a surface of genus <m>\ge 2</m> admits an integral that is polynomial in velocities and is functionally independent of the energy integral.
          The state of the art if the surface is the sphere or the torus can be explained by the following table:

      In the table, ``Degree'' means the smallest degree of a non-trivial integral polynomial in velocities. ``All is known'' means that there exists an effective description and classification
      (which can be found in<nbsp/><xref ref="Bo-Ma-Fo1998"/>).
    </p>
    <p>
      A simpler version of the question is when we replace the geodesic flow in the question above by a Lagrangian system with the Lagrangian of the form <m>L(x, \xi):=K + U=\sum g_{ij}\xi^i \xi^j + U(x)</m>.
      In this case we assume that the integral is a sum of polynomials of degrees 3 and 1 in velocities.
      The ``partial negative results'' in the table above correspond to this case;
      moreover, in most cases it is assumed that the metric <m>g_{ij}</m> is flat,
      see for example<nbsp/>[<a knowl="Bialy1987.knowl">Bialy1987</a>,
      <a knowl="Mironov2010.knowl">Mironov2010</a>,
      <a knowl="De-Ko-Tr2012.knowl">De-Ko-Tr2012</a>]
      (and<nbsp/><xref ref="Bialy2010"/> for results that do not require this assumption).
    </p>
    <p>
      Similar conjectures could be posed for integrals of every degree.
      If the degree <m>d</m> is odd,
      the conjecture is that the existence of an integral that is polynomial of the degree <m>d</m> in velocities implies the existence of a Killing vector field.
      If the degree <m>d</m> is even,
      the conjecture is that the existence of an integral that is polynomial of the degree <m>d</m> in velocities implies the existence of an integral quadratic in velocities and not proportional to the energy integral.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note also that by<nbsp/><xref ref="Kru-Mat2016"/> a <m>C^2</m>-generic metric does not admit a non-trivial integral which is polynomial in velocities.

      Further open problems on integrable systems and integrable geodesic flows can be found in the recent survey<nbsp/><xref ref="BMMT2018"/>.

    <title>Integrable billiards and the Birkhoff conjecture</title>
    <p>
      Let <m>\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^2</m> be a strictly convex domain bounded by a smooth curve.
      We consider the (internal) billiard problem.
      The ball (a point) moves with unit speed and no friction following a rectilinear path inside the domain.
      When the ball hits the boundary,
      it is reflected elastically according to the law of optical reflection:
      the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      We ask whether there exists a non-constant smooth function on the tangent bundle which is constant along every trajectory.
      It is well known, see e.g.
      <xref ref="Tabachnikov2005"/>, that a billiard in an ellipse is integrable.
    </p>
    <openconjecture>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If the billiard in <m>\Omega</m> is integrable,
          then the boundary of <m>\Omega</m> is an ellipse.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <status>
        <p>
          The special case of the conjecture in which the caustics of the billiard trajectories are assumed to foliate the whole of <m>\Omega</m> except for one point was proved in<nbsp/><xref ref="Bialy1993"/>.
          Recently, essential progress is due to<nbsp/><xref ref="Av-Si-Ka2016"/>,
          where the conjecture was proved for tables bounded by small perturbations of ellipses of small eccentricity.
        </p>

        <p>
          One can also assume that the integral is polynomial in velocities;

    <title>Metrics such that one can explicitly find all geodesics</title>
    <p>
      Geodesics of a metric are solutions of a non-linear ordinary differential equation
      <m>\nabla_{\dot \gamma} \dot \gamma=0</m> which can not be explicitly solved in most cases.
      There are only a few examples of 2-dimensional metrics for which one can explicitly find all geodesics using elementary functions:
      they are metrics of constant curvature and Darboux-superintegrable metrics
      (see<nbsp/><xref ref="Br-Ma-Ma2008"/> for definition).
      An interesting problem is to construct other examples of metrics such that all geodesics are explicitly known.
      A related problem
      (asked recently in<nbsp/><xref ref="Tao2010"/>)
      is to construct metrics with an explicitly given distance function.
