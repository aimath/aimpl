    <title>Ergodic geodesic flows</title>
    <p>
      Does every closed manifold
      (with dimension <m>\geq 2</m>)
      admit a metric (Riemannian or Finsler) with ergodic geodesic flow?
    </p>
    <p>
      This is known for surfaces~\cite{Donnay1988II}, for <m>3</m>-manifolds~\cite{Katok1994}, for product manifolds in which the factors have dimenson <m>\leq 3</m> \cite{Bur-Ger1994}, and for spheres \cite{Bur-Ged}. Donnay and Pugh have shown that any embedded surface can be perturbed,
      in the <m>C^0</m> topology to an embedded surface whose geodesic flow is ergodic \cite{Don-Pugh2004}. These constructions all make essential use of the focusing caps introduced by Donnay in \cite{Donnay1988I}.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general problem is still wide open despite some reports of its solution (p.~87 of \cite{Berger2000} and Section 10.9 of \cite{Berger2003}).

          Metrics close to the standard metric on <m>S^2</m> would be especially interesting.
          The best result in this direction is due to Burago and Ivanov \cite{Bur-Iva2016}. They exhibit smooth Finsler metrics with positive measure theoretic entropy that are small perturbations of the round metric on <m>S^4</m>.

    <title>The measure of transitive and recurrent sets</title>
    <p>
      Let <m>(M^2 , g)</m> be a closed surface with ergodic geodesic flow.
      Then every tangent vector lies in one of the following sets:
      <md>
        <mrow>T_b \amp :=\{ v\in SM\mid \textrm{ any lift of \(\gamma_v\) stays in a  bounded subset  of \(\widetilde M\)} \},</mrow>
        <mrow>T_p \amp :=\{ v\in SM\mid \textrm{ any lift of \(\gamma_v\) is unbounded, and  approaches  infinity properly} \},</mrow>
        <mrow>T_i \amp :=TM\setminus (T_b \cup T_p)</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      All three sets are measurable and invariant under the geodesic flow.
      By ergodicity one of them has full measure.

          Which of these sets has full measure?

        <p>
          The expected answer depends on the genus of the surface:
          on the torus the set <m>T_{i}</m> should have full measure,
          and on the surfaces of higher genus <m>T_{p}</m> should have full measure.

        <p>
          In this context it is natural to consider only minimizing geodesics:
          if one shows that the set of minimizing geodesics has non-zero measure,
          then it has full measure by ergodicity of the geodesic flow.
          However, there exist examples of metrics on the torus such that the set of minimising geodesics has small Hausdorff dimension.

      We denote by <m>\mathcal G^k(M)</m> the space of all smooth Riemannian metrics on <m>M</m> with the <m>C^k</m>-topology.
      Riemannian metrics are sections of the bundle <m>S^2T^*M</m>.

      We use <m>C^k</m>-topology either locally or on closed manifolds,
      where we may assume that the atlas is finite and the gluing functions have all derivatives bounded.
      Then the convergence in the topology means the following:
      a sequence <m>g^{(1)},g^{(2)},\dots</m> of metrics converges to a metric <m>g</m> in the topology <m>C^k</m> if in local charts the entries <m>g^{(m)}_{ij}</m>

    <title>Finsler metrics with positive flag curvature</title>
    <p>
      Flag curvature is the Finslerian analogue of sectional curvature.
      It was shown in \cite{Akbar-Zadeh1988} that:
      any closed Finsler surface with constant flag curvature zero is locally Minkowskian;
      any sufficiently smooth closed Finsler surface with constant negative curvature is Riemannian (there are non-Riemannian examples which are not sufficiently smooth);
      and any connected closed Finsler surface with constant positive flag curvature is homeomorphic to <m>S^2</m> or <m>\Real P^2</m>.
      The result for negative flag curvature also follows from \cite{Foulon1997} and is true in all dimensions.
    </p>
    <openproblem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Describe Finsler metrics on <m>S^2</m> of flag curvature <m>1</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <suggestion>
        <p>
          If such a metric is reversible,
          then it is the round Riemannian metric \cite{Bryant2006}. The Katok examples described in <xref ref="exkatok">Section</xref>
          have constant flag curvature <m>1</m>.
          All projectively flat metrics of constant flag curvature on <m>S^2</m> are described in \cite{Bryant1997}. Bryant has also constructed examples that are not projectively flat \cite{Bryant1996,Bryant2002}. Unlike Katok's example,
          all of the examples in Bryant's papers are Zoll,
          i.e.\ all of their closed geodesics are closed and of the same length.
        </p>
      </suggestion>
      <status>
        <p>
          Even though the Finsler metrics of constant flag curvature <m>1</m> on <m>S^2</m> are not fully classified,
          the possible behavior of their geodesic flows is understood.
          It is shown in \cite{BFIMZ2019} that the geodesic flow of a metric of constant curvature <m>1</m> is conjugated to that of the Katok metric.
          This implies that one of the following two possibilities must occur:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Precisely two geodesics are closed.
              These two geodesics are a simple closed curve parametrized in opposite directions.
              This curve is tangent to a non-trivial Killing vector field which vanishes precisely at two points.
              All of the non-closed geodesics have the same asymptotic rotation number <m>\rho</m> around the fixed points of the Killing field.
              There are distinct irrational numbers <m>\alpha_1</m> and
              <m>\alpha_2</m> such that the lengths of the two closed geodesics are
              <m>\alpha_1\pi</m> and <m>\alpha_2\pi</m>.
            </li>
            <li>
              All geodesics are closed.
              There are an even integer <m>k</m> and positive rational numbers <m>\beta_1</m> and <m>\beta_2</m> with
              <m>\tfrac{1}{\beta_1} + \tfrac{1}{\beta_2}=1</m> such that at most two geodesics have length different from <m>k\pi</m> and the lengths of the exceptional geodesics are
              <m>\beta_1\pi</m> and <m>\beta_2\pi</m>.
              In the case <m>\beta_1=\beta_2=2</m>,
              all geodesics are closed and have the same length <m>2\pi</m>;
              we will call such metrics Zoll metrics.

          Moreover, the Finsler metrics satisfying (i) necessary admit a Killing vector field and are quite well understood.
          Applying the Zermelo transformation to such metrics
          (see e.g. \cite{Fou-Mat2018}),
          one obtains non-Zoll metrics satisfying
          (ii).
          Moreover, any such metric (of flag curvature <m>1</m> on <m>S^2</m> and satisfying (ii)) admitting a Killing vector field can be obtained by this procedure.
          Unfortunately,
          no other examples of non-Zoll metrics satisfying (ii) are known.

          which is explained in \cite{BFIMZ2019}. Note that there are Finsler surfaces with positive flag curvature that contain non-intersecting closed geodesics,
          see \cite{BFIMZ2019, Rademacher2016} This is possible because a curve must have geodesic parameterizations in <em>both</em>
          directions in order to be totally geodesic,
          non-reversible Finsler metrics can therefore have simple closed geodesics that are not totally geodesic submanifolds.

    <title>Gaidukov in higher dimensions</title>
    <p>
      We consider a Riemannian metric on an oriented closed surface <m>M</m> of genus <m>\ge 1</m>.
      Let <m>\Gamma</m> be a non-trivial free homotopy class and <m>p</m> a point in <m>M</m>.
      A theorem of Gaidukov \cite{Gaidukov1966} says that there exist a closed geodesic
      <m>\gamma:\Real\to M</m> in <m>\Gamma</m> and a ray
      <m>\beta:[0,\infty)\to M</m> with <m>\beta(0)=p</m> such that
      <m>dist(\beta(t), \gamma(t)) \to 0</m> as <m>t \to \infty</m>.

    <title>Systolic and diastolic inequalities  for  surfaces  (communicated by Guth,  Rotman and Sabourau)</title>
    <p>
      Let <m>(M,g)</m> be a compact Riemannian surface.
      The inequalities in question compare the length of certain short closed geodesics with the square root of the area of <m>(M,g)</m>, Recall that the systole
      <m>sys(M,g)</m> is the least length of a non-trivial closed geodesic.
      Two other geometrically meaningful constants can be defined by the following minimax procedure:
      <me>
        L(M,g) = \inf_f \max_{t\in\Real} F[f^{-1}(t)]
      </me>,
      in which the infimum is taken over all (Morse) functions
      <m>f: M \to \Real</m> and the functional <m>F</m> is either (a) the total length of
      <m>f^{-1}(t)</m> or (b) the length of its longest component.
      In both cases <m>L(M,g)</m> is realized as the length of a certain union of closed geodesics.
      In case (a), <m>L(M,g)</m> is one definition of the diastole
      <m>\textrm{dias} (M,g)</m> of the Riemannian surface
      (at least two different notions of diastole have been studied;
      see \cite{Bal-Sab2010}).
    </p>
    <p>
      By a result originally due to \cite{Croke1988} and later improved in \cite{Nab-Rot2002}, \cite{Sabourau2004} and \cite{Rotman2006}, for every Riemannian metric <m>g</m> on the sphere <m>S^2</m> one has
      <me>
        \textrm{sys} (S^2, g) \leq \sqrt{ 32} \sqrt{\textrm{area} (S^2, g)}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Actually, in \cite{Croke1988} it was suggested that the constant
      <m>\sqrt{32}</m> in the above inequality can be replaced by <m>\sqrt{2\sqrt{3}}</m>.
      The following example due to \cite{Croke1988} shows that one can not go below <m>\sqrt{2\sqrt{3}}</m>:
      take two congruent equilateral triangles and glue them along their boundaries.
      The example is not smooth and suggests the study of systolic inequalities on the space of smooth metrics with conical singularities.
      On the space of such metrics,
      let us consider the function
      <me>
        \sigma(g)= \frac{\textrm{area} (S^2, g)}{ \textrm{sys} (S^2, g)^2}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This function has many nice properties;
      for example it is Lipschitz with respect to the appropriate distance on the space of metrics.
      By \cite{Croke1988}, the function has a positive minimum,
      and the natural conjecture is that the minimum is attained on the sphere constructed from two equilateral triangles as described above.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other critical points of this function are also interesting: Balacheff showed that the round metric on the sphere is a critical point \cite{Balacheff2006}. Moreover,
      by \cite{Alv-Bal2014}, Zoll Finsler manifolds <m>(M, F)</m> of all dimension satisfy the following alternative:
      for any Finsler deformation <m>F_t</m> with <m>F_0=F</m> either the function
      <m>t \mapsto \sigma(F_t)</m> has a strict local minimum at <m>t = 0</m>,
      or the family <m>F_t</m> is tangent up to every order to the space of Zoll metrics.
      In dimension 2, the result is further improved in \cite{ABHS2017,ABHS2018}, where it is shown that both in the Riemannian and in the Finslerian cases the function
      <m>\sigma(F_t)</m> defined above has a strict local minimum at <m>t = 0</m> if <m>F</m> is a Zoll metric.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note though that in the papers \cite{Alv-Bal2014,ABHS2017,ABHS2018} the metrics and the deformation are assumed to be smooth
      (at least <m>C^3</m>).
      In view of the Croke's example,
      it may be natural to consider also non-smooth metrics and non-smooth deformations.

          then the positive answer follows from \cite{ABHS2017}. In that paper the condition ``close'' is given explicitly in terms of a pinching condition on the curvature.
          It is proved that in the neighborhood of a Zoll metric consisting of metrics such that this pinching condition is satisfied,
          the equality <m>\sigma = 1/\pi</m> holds if and only if the metric is Zoll.

          A corollary of one of the main results in \cite{ABHS2018} generalizes this to Finsler metrics and a <m>C^3</m>-neighborhood of the Zoll metrics : more precisely,
          <m>\sigma \ge 1/\pi</m> in a small <m>C^3</m>-neighbourhood of all Zoll Finsler metrics on <m>S^2</m>,
          with equality if and only if the metric is Zoll.

          So a related question is as follows:
          under which topologies is the round metric a local minimizer of
          <m>\sigma(F_t)</m> or <m>\sigma(g_t)</m>?
          Does this remain true for weaker topologies than <m>C^2</m>,
          e.g.\ <m>C^1</m> or Gromov-Hausdorff?

          For surfaces of higher genus,
          there exists a constant <m>C</m> such that
          <men xml:id="gr">
            \textrm{sys} (M,g) \leq C \frac{\log( \textrm{genus} (M))}{ \sqrt{\textrm{genus} (M)}}{\textrm{area} (M, g)};
          </men>
          the dependence on the genus of <m>M</m> in this inequality is sharp.
          In \cite[Note 7.2.12]{Berger2003} inequality <xref ref="gr"/> is attributed to Gromov and it is explained from what papers,
          results and ideas of Gromov <xref ref="gr"/> follows.
          Section 7.2.1 of \cite{Berger2003} is a very nice survey on systolic inequalities for surfaces.

          For the diastole defined by (a), Balacheff and Sabourau showed in \cite{Bal-Sab2010} that there is a constant <m>C</m> such that
          <me>
            \textrm{dias} (M,g) \leq C\sqrt{\textrm{genus} (M)}\sqrt{\textrm{area} (M, g)};
          </me>
          the dependence of this inequality on the genus is again optimal.

      <title>Guth</title>

          Is there a constant <m>C</m> such that the invariant defined by (b) above is bounded from above by <m>C\sqrt{\textrm{area} (M,g)}</m>?

          An affirmative answer to Guth's question would mean that the three quantities under consideration all depend on the genus in different ways,
          and are therefore measuring different features of the surface.
          A positive answer would also show that one can always find a pants decomposition of a closed Riemannian surface of genus <m>g</m> into <m>3g-3</m> disjoint closed geodesics of length at most <m>C \sqrt{\textrm{area} (M)}</m>.
          This would precisely give the optimal Bers' constant for a genus <m>g</m> surface.
          Even for hyperbolic surfaces,
          this question is still open
          (see \cite{Buser1992} for partial results).

          The question above also makes sense in higher dimensions.
          In this case <m>f^{-1}(t)</m> would be an <m>(n-1)</m>-complex,
          where <m>n</m> is the dimension of the manifold,
          and <m>F</m> would measure its total volume or the volume of its largest component.

    <title>Metrics such that all geodesics are closed</title>
    <openquestion>

        <p>
          This is a classical topic --- the first examples go back at least to \cite{Zoll1903}; see \cite{Besse1978} for details.
          The book \cite{Besse1978} is still up to date,
          and many problems/questions listed in it
          (in particular in Chapter 0 \S D)
          are still open.
          As the most interesting question from their list we suggest:
        </p>
      </preamble>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>M</m> be a closed manifold not covered by a sphere.
          Let <m>g</m> be a metric on <m>M</m> for which all geodesics are closed.
          Is <m>(M,g)</m> a CROSS (=compact rank one symmetric) manifold (with the standard metric)?

          Of course, variants of this question can be asked about Finsler and Lorentzian metrics.
          In the Finsler setting,
          one may ask for example to describe all Finsler metrics on <m>CP(n)</m> such that their geodesics are geodesics of the standard (Fubini-Study) metric on <m>CP(n)</m>.
          Of course, the answer in the Finslerian case is expected to be much more difficult;
          for example by \cite{Bryant1996} on the 2-sphere there exists a two-parameter family of projectively flat Finsler metrics on the sphere,
          such that the flag curvature is <m>+1</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Lorenzian setting,
          one can ask to construct all manifolds such that all light-like geodesics are closed,
          see e.g.\ \cite{Mou-Suh2013, Suhr2013b}.

          An easier version of the question above is the following conjecture sometimes attributed to Berger:

      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>(M,g)</m> be a closed simply connected manifold such that all geodesics are closed.
          Then all geodesics have the same length.

          The conjecture is proved when <m>M</m> is the sphere of dimension <m>\ne 3</m> in \cite{Gro-Gro1981, Rad-Wil2015}.
