  <title>Notation and Definitions</title>
  <p>
    In this paper <m>M</m> is a connected <m>C^\infty</m> manifold and
    <m>\widetilde M</m> is its universal cover.
    We consider various structures on <m>M</m> that create geodesics: Riemannian
    (later also semi-Riemannian)
    metric <m>g</m>, Finsler metric <m>F</m>,
    magnetic structure~<m>\omega</m>.
    The unit tangent bundle defined by such a structure is denoted by <m>SM</m> and <m>\phi_t</m> is the geodesic flow on <m>SM</m>.
    The geodesic defined by a vector
    <m>v \in SM</m> is denoted by <m>\gamma_v</m>;
    it is parametrized by arclength unless otherwise specified.
  </p>
  <p>
    The free loop space <m>\Lambda M</m> is the set of all piecewise smooth mappings from the circle <m>S^1</m> to the manifold equipped with the natural topology.
    When <m>M</m> has a Riemannian metric
    (or other suitable structure)
    we can consider the subspace
    <m>\Lambda_T M</m> of loops with length <m>\leq T</m>.
    Similarly given two points <m>p,q \in M</m>,
    we denote by <m>\Omega(p,q)</m> the space of piecewise smooth paths from <m>p</m> to <m>q</m> and by
    <m>\Omega_T(p,q)</m> the subspace of paths with length at most <m>T</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We define the energy functional on <m>\Lambda M</m> by
    <me>
      c \mapsto \int_{S^1}\|\dot c(s)\|^2 \,d\lambda(s)
    </me>,
    where <m>\|\cdot\|</m> is the norm induced by a Riemannian metric or other suitable structure and <m>\lambda</m> is Lebesgue measure on <m>S^1</m> normalized to be a probability measure.
    The critical points of this functional are the closed geodesics for the metric (parametrized at the constant speed <m>Length(c))</m>.
    In the case of <m>\Omega(p,q)</m>,
    the circle <m>S^1</m> is replaced by the interval <m>[0,1]</m>.
