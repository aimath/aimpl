  <title>Stationary  nets (Communicated by Rotman)</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      A graph <m>G</m> in a Riemannian surface <m>(S,g)</m> is called a \knownterminology{ stationary net,} if every edge is a geodesic and if at every vertex the sum of diverging unit vectors is zero.
      Vertices must have valence at least <m>3</m>.

    <title>Stationary <m>\Theta</m>-nets</title>
    <p>
      A <m>\Theta</m>-graph is a graph that looks like the Greek letter ``Theta'': two vertices connected by three edges,
      see the picture below.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Does every metric on <m>S^2</m> admit a stationary <m>\Theta</m>-graph?

        <p>
          Partial results in this direction were obtained in<nbsp/><xref ref="Has-Mor1996"/>:
          they showed that on every sphere of positive curvature there exists a stationary <m>\Theta</m>-net,
          or a stationary {eight curve} net,
          or a stationary eyeglasses net.

    <title>Density of stationary nets and of closed geodesics</title>
    <p>
      We call a stationary net non-trivial if it has at least one vertex of valency <m>\ge 3</m>,
      in other words if it is not a disjoint union of simple closed geodesics.
    </p>
    <openquestion>
      <title>Gromov</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Are non-trivial stationary nets dense on any closed Riemannian surface?
          In other words, for each non-empty open subset <m>U</m>,
          is there a stationary net intersecting <m>U</m>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <context>
        <p>
          The answer is evidently positive for every surface of constant curvature.
          Indeed, in this case tangent vectors to closed geodesics are dense in the unit tangent bundle and we can take a finite union of closed intersecting geodesics as a stationary net.
          On other manifolds, the answer is less trivial,
          for example because in higher dimensions periodic geodesics may not intersect.
