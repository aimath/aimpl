  <title>Manifolds without conjugate points (rigidity conjectures)</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      There are many rigidity results for manifolds with non-positive curvature that might extend to manifolds with no conjugate points.
      One still has the basic setting of a universal cover homeomorphic to <m>\Real^n</m> in which any two points are joined by a unique geodesic.
      However the convexity of the length of Jacobi fields,
      which is the basis of many arguments used in non-positive curvature,
      is no longer available.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two major results of this nature are:
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="Hopf">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A Riemannian metric with no conjugate points on a torus is flat.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <theorem xml:id="BangEmm">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>g</m> be a complete Riemannian metric without conjugate points on the plane <m>\Real^2</m>.
          Then for every point <m>p</m>
          <me>
            \liminf_{r \to \infty} \frac{\text{  area } \,B(p,r)}{\pi r^2} \geq 1

          with equality if and only if <m>g</m> is flat.

      <xref ref="Hopf">Theorems</xref> and <xref ref="BangEmm"></xref>
      are easy for manifolds with non-positive curvature but require subtle arguments in the context of no conjugate points.

    <p>
      The two dimensional case of <xref ref="Hopf">Theorem</xref>
      was proved by E.~Hopf<nbsp/><xref ref="Hopf1948"/> and the general case by Burago and Ivanov<nbsp/><xref ref="Bur-Iva1994"/>.
      The Lorentzian analogue of <xref ref="Hopf">Theorem</xref> is false;
      two dimensional counterexamples are constructed in<nbsp/><xref ref="Bav-Mou2013"/>.
      The Finsler analogue is also false as there are examples of Finsler metrics without conjugate points on the torus that are not the Minkowski metric, see e.g.
      <xref ref="Busemann1955"/>.
    </p>
    <openquestion>
      <title>Communicated by S. Ivanov</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Is the geodesic flow of a Finsler metric on the torus conjugate to that of the (locally) Minkowski metric on the torus?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <suggestion>
        <p>
          All smooth examples we are aware of have geodesic flows smoothly conjugate to that of the locally Minkowski metric,
          but generally it is not even known whether the velocity vectors of geodesics with irrational rotation numbers are dense in the tangent bundle.

          The answer is positive in dimension 2<nbsp/><xref ref="Green1954"/>.
          The question is open in higher dimensions;
          the proof in<nbsp/><xref ref="Green1956"/> is incorrect.
          The answer to the corresponding question about Finsler metrics is negative.
          The Teichm\"uller metric on Teichm\"uller space has no conjugate points,
          but Masur showed that there exist two rays through the same point which do not diverge<nbsp/><xref ref="Masur1975"/>.

    <title>Parallel postulate questions</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        \ The flat strip theorem is another basic tool in the study of manifolds with non-positive curvature.
        It states that ``parallel geodesics'' must bound a flat strip.
        More precisely if if <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m> are two geodesics in a simply connected manifold with non-positive curvature such that
        <m>dist(\alpha(t),\beta(t))</m> is bounded for all <m>t \in \Real</m>,
        then the two geodesics are the edges of a totally geodesic isometric immersion of the Riemannian product of <m>\Real</m> with an interval.
      </p>
      <p>
        The flat strip theorem fails for manifolds with no conjugate points
        (although it does extend fairly easily to manifolds without focal points).
        Counter examples have been given in<nbsp/><xref ref="Burns1992"/> and by Kleiner
        (unpublished).
        Kleiner's example has a copy of
        <m>\mathbb{ Z} \times \mathbb{ Z}</m> in its fundamental group,
        but does not contain a corresponding flat torus.
        He perturbs the Heintze example (Example 4 in<nbsp/><xref ref="Ba-Br-Eb1985"/>),
        which we described in <xref ref="relationsbetween">subsection</xref>.
        The following basic question appears to be open in general
        (although Proposition 4 in<nbsp/><xref ref="Eschenburg1977"/> suggests an affirmative answer under some extra hypotheses).

      <openquestion>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Must homotopic closed geodesics in a manifold of dimension <m>\ge 3</m> with no conjugate points be homotopic through closed geodesics?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <context>
          <p>
            In dimension 2, the answer is positive.
            This follows from a modification of the Birkhoff minimax procedure recalled in <xref ref="closed_geodesics">\S</xref>
            combined with the results/methods of<nbsp/><xref ref="Morse1924"/>, as we now explain.

          <p>
            Consider two homotopic closed geodesics <m>\gamma_0</m> and <m>\gamma_1</m>.
            They have the same length by<nbsp/><xref ref="Morse1924"/>,
            which we denote by <m>L_0</m> and their lifts to the universal cover bound a periodic strip <m>S</m> by<nbsp/><xref ref="Morse1924"/>.
            Next, take a continuous bijection <m>h:S^1 \times [0,1] \to M</m> such that
            <m>S^1 \times \{0\} = \gamma_0</m> and <m>h(S^1 \times \{1\}) = \gamma_1</m>.
            Then apply to each curve <m>h(S^1 \times \{t\})</m> a shortening procedure;
            in dimension 2 one can organize the shortening procedure such that the lift of the projection to the universal cover does not leave the strip <m>S</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The natural modification of the Birkhoff minimax procedure proves then the existence of a closed geodesic homotopic to
            <m>\gamma_0</m> whose lift to the universal cover lies in the strip <m>S</m>;
            this geodesic also has length <m>L_0</m>.
            Arguing as in<nbsp/><xref ref="Morse1924"/>,
            we obtain that the lift of this geodesic cuts the strip in two substrips,
            <m>S_1</m> and <m>S_2</m>.
            Recursively applying the same arguments,
            we obtain that the strip <m>S</m> has a everywhere dense set of nonintersecting geodesics such that any of them cuts the strip into two substrips.
            Passing to the limit we get a foliation of the strip by lifts of closed geodesics and hence the desired homotopy of <m>\gamma_0</m> to
            <m>\gamma_1</m> through closed geodesics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that for dimensions <m>\ge 3</m>,
            part of the argument still works
            (in particular homotopic closed geodesics in a closed manifold with no conjugate points must have the same length)
            and one can show that <m>\gamma_0</m> and
            <m>\gamma_1</m> belong to the same connected component of the set of closed curves of length equal to <m>L_0</m>,
            but it is not clear why the set of closed geodesics homotopic to <m>\gamma_0</m> is path-connected.

            One can still hope for a version of the flat strip theorem in manifolds with no conjugate points in which there is a large enough family of ``parallel'' geodesics.
            One would then hope to find a totally geodesic isometric immersion of the Euclidean plane.
            Rigidity might hold in the large,
            even though the examples above show that it breaks down locally.

            The simplest question of this type asks if a Riemannian plane satisfying Euclid's 5th postulate must be flat.
            Consider the plane <m>\Real^2</m> with a complete Riemannian metric.
            Assume that for every geodesic and for every point not on the geodesic there exists precisely one non-trivial geodesic that passes through the point and does not intersect the geodesic.
            This assumption implies that the metric has no conjugate points.

            The question looks like a question in the synthetic geometry,
