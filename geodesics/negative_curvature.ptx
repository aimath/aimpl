    <title>Does the marked length spectrum  determine the metric?</title>
    <p>
      Suppose <m>(M, g)</m> is a closed Riemannian manifold.
      The marked length spectrum of <m>M</m> is the function that assigns to each free homotopy class of loops the infimum of the length of loops in the class (i.e.~the length of the shortest closed geodesic lying in this class).

    <openconjecture xml:id="mlscon">

      <statement>
        <p>
          Two metrics with negative curvature on a compact manifold must be isometric if they have the same marked length spectrum.

          Croke and Otal showed that this conjecture is true for metrics on surfaces<nbsp/>[<a knowl="Otal1990.knowl">Otal1990</a>,
          <a knowl="Croke1990.knowl">Croke1990</a>]. Indeed it is enough to assume that the metrics have non-positive curvature.
          The problem is open in higher dimensions.
          Hamenst\"adt showed that the geodesic flows of the two metrics must be <m>C^0</m>-conjugate,
          thereby reducing the problem to <xref ref="conjcon">Conjecture</xref>
          in the next subsection<nbsp/><xref ref="Hamenstadt1991"/>.
          Guillarmou and Lefeuvre<nbsp/><xref ref="Gui-Lef2018"/> have shown that the conjecture is locally true in sense that two close enough metrics with Anosov geodesic flow and the same length spectrum are isometric.

          One obtains a natural interesting modification of this conjecture by replacing negative curvature by non-existence of conjugate points.
          On the other hand some restriction on the metrics is necessary as the examples of Croke and Kleiner which we describe in the next subsection provide non-isometric metrics with the same marked length spectrum.
          It is also necessary to consider the marked length spectrum rather than the length spectrum.
          Vign\'eras gave examples of non-isometric hyperbolic surfaces that have the same set of lengths for their closed geodesics<nbsp/><xref ref="Vigneras1980"/>.

          One can ask a similar question for non-manifolds.
          Consider a 2-dimensional (metrical) simplicial complex such that every simplex is hyperbolic with geodesic edges and such that <m>CAT(-1)</m> condition holds on every vertex.
          Assume in addition that every edge is contained in at least two simplices.

          Does the marked length spectrum determine such a metric (in the class of all locally <m>CAT(-1)</m> metrics on this space,

          If the simplicial complex is (topologically) a manifold,

          The questions above are closely related to the boundary rigidity problem,
          which we now recall.
          Given a compact manifold <m>M</m> with smooth boundary <m>N</m>,
          a Riemannian metric <m>g</m> on <m>M</m> induces a non-negative real valued function <m>d</m> on
          <m>N \times N</m> where <m>d(p, q)</m> is the distance in <m>(M, g)</m> between <m>p</m> and <m>q</m>.
          We call <m>(M,g)</m> boundary rigid if a Riemannian manifold <m>g'</m> on <m>M</m> that induces the same function on
          <m>N \times N</m> must be isometric to <m>g'</m>.

          Michel conjectured in<nbsp/><xref ref="Michel1981"/> that <m>(M,g)</m> should be boundary rigid if it is <em>simple</em>.

          <m>\gamma_{p,q}:[0,1] \to M</m> and this unique geodesic has the property that

          The conjecture is true in dimension two;
          indeed it is enough to assume that one of the manifolds has non-positive curvature<nbsp/><xref ref="Cr-Fa-Fe1992"/>.
          It follows from the theorem of Besson-Courtois-Gallot discussed in the next subsection that the conjecture holds if one of the metrics is locally symmetric.
          Croke and Kleiner showed that <m>C^1</m> conjugacy implies that the volumes of the manifolds are the same with no restrictions on the metrics and implies isometry of the metrics if one of them has a global parallel vector (as is the case in a Riemannian product)<nbsp/><xref ref="Cro-Klei1994"/>.

          by the locally symmetric metrics.
          It is now known that the locally symmetric metrics are critical points for both entropies<nbsp/><xref ref="Ka-Kn-We1991"/>,

          A program to construct open sets of metrics whose geodesic flows have Anosov splitting that have low regularity of the Anosov splitting on large subsets of the unit tangent bundle is explained in section 4 of<nbsp/><xref ref="Has-Wil1999"/>;
          see in particular Proposition 12.
          The idea is to perturb a suitable base example.
          This base example must have directions in its unstable manifolds with widely different expansion rates.
          Unfortunately there are no known examples of geodesic flows that are suitable bases for the perturbation argument;
          see the discussion at the end of section 4 in<nbsp/><xref ref="Has-Wil1999"/>.
          Along all geodesics in complex hyperbolic space one has Lyapunov exponents of 1 and 2 corresponding to parallel families of planes with curvature <m>-1</m> and <m>-4</m> respectively.
