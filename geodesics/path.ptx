  <title>Path and loop spaces</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      As noted in the previous section,
      one of the main approaches to proving the existence of closed geodesics is to use topological complexity of the loop space
      <m>\Lambda M</m> to force the existence of critical points of the energy functional.
      Loops with length <m>\leq T</m> correspond to critical points in <m>\Lambda_T M</m>.
      Similarly geodesics joining two points <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> can be studied by investigating the path spaces
      <m>\Omega(p,q)</m> or <m>\Omega_T(p,q)</m>.
      The homology of these spaces have been much studied.

    <title>Sums of the Betti numbers</title>
    <p>
      Let <m>p, q</m> be points in a Riemannian manifold.
      The space <m>\Omega_T(p,q)</m> of paths from <m>p</m> to <m>q</m> with length <m>\leq T</m> has the homotopy type of a finite complex
      (see e.g.<nbsp/>\cite{Milnor1963}),
      and hence the sum of its Betti numbers is finite for each <m>T</m>.
      The same is true for the space
      <m>\Lambda_TM</m> of loops with length at most<nbsp/><m>T</m>.

          How do the sums of the Betti numbers for <m>\Lambda_TM</m> and
          <m>\Omega(_T(p,q)</m> grow as <m>T\to \infty</m>?
          Does the growth depend on the metric?

          It was shown by Gromov in \cite{Gromov2001} that if <m>M</m> is simply connected there is a constant <m>C</m> such that the sum of the Betti numbers of
          <m>\Lambda_{CN}</m> is at least <m>\sum_{i=0}^N b_{i}(\Lambda)</m>.

      <title>Gromov</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Does the number of closed geodesics with length <m>\leq T</m> grow exponentially as
          <m>T \to \infty</m> if the Betti numbers of the loop space grow exponentially?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <status>
        <p>
          From \cite{Gromov1978} it follows that the answer is positive for generic metrics.

          Here is a potentially interesting example.
          Consider <m>f:S^3\times S^3\to S^3\times S^3</m> such that the induced action on <m>H_3(S^3\times S^3)</m> is hyperbolic.
          Let <m>M</m> be the mapping torus for <m>f</m>,
          i.e.<nbsp/> <m>S^3\times S^3 \times [0,1]</m> with <m>(x,1)</m> identified with
          <m>(f(x),0)</m> for each <m>x \in S^3 \times S^3</m>.
          Then <m>\pi_1({M})=Z</m> and the universal cover
          <m>\widetilde M</m> is homotopy equivalent to <m>S^3\times S^3</m>.
          Hence the Betti numbers of the loop space grow polynomially.
          On the other hand,
          the hyperbolic action of <m>f</m> on <m>H_3</m> gives hope for exponential growth of the sum of the Betti numbers of <m>\Omega_T(p,q)</m>.

    <title>Stability of minimax   levels (communicated by Nancy Hingston)</title>
    <p>
      Let <m>M</m> be a compact manifold with a Riemannian
      (or Finsler)
      metric <m>g</m>.
      Let <m>G</m> be a finitely generated abelian group.
      Given a non-trivial homology class <m>X \in H_{\ast}(\Lambda M;G)</m>,
      the critical (minimax) level of <m>X</m> is
      <md>
        <mrow>cr\,X \amp   =\inf\{a:X\in\text{ Image } H_{\ast}(\Lambda_a M;G)\}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp   =\underset{x\epsilon X}{\inf}\text{ } \underset{\gamma\in\text{ Image } x}{\sup}Length({\gamma})</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Here <m>\Lambda_a M</m> is the subset of the free loop space
      <m>\Lambda M</m> consisting of loops whose length is at most <m>a</m>.
      The second definition is the minimax definition:
      the singular chain <m>x</m> ranges over all representatives of the homology class <m>X</m>,
      and <m>\gamma</m> over all the points in the image of <m>x</m>,
      which are loops in <m>M</m>.

          Do there exist a metric on <m>S^{n}</m> and a homology class <m>X \in H_{\ast}(\Lambda M;\mathbb{Z} )</m> with
          <me>
            0 \lt  cr(mX) \lt  c r(X)
          </me>

          The special case of this question,
          when dimension is two and <m>m</m> is odd,
          was answered negatively in \cite[Corollary 1.3]{Cha-Lio2014}.

          Given a metric <m>g</m> on <m>M</m> and a finitely generated abelian group <m>G</m>,
          the <em>global mean frequency</em> is defined as
          <men xml:id="ast">
            \alpha_{g,G}=\underset{\deg X\rightarrow\infty}{\lim}\frac{\deg X}{crX}
          </men>,
          where the limit is taken over all non-trivial homology classes <m>X \in H_{\ast}(\Lambda S^{n};G)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Resonance Theorem from \cite{Hin-Rad2013} says that if <m>M</m> is a sphere and <m>G</m> is a field,
          the limit <xref ref="ast"/> exists.
          It is clear in this case that
          <m>\alpha_{g,G}</m> depends on the metric <m>g</m>.
          But does it really depend on the field <m>G</m>?
          The degree of <m>X</m> does not depend on anything but <m>X</m>.
          But what about the critical level <m>cr\,X</m>?
          Does <m>cr\,X</m> depend on the coefficients?
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us note that for the spheres the non-trivial homology groups of the free loop space
          (with integer coefficients)
          are all <m>\mathbb{Z}</m> or <m>\mathbb{Z} _{2}=:\mathbb{Z} /2\mathbb{Z}</m>.
          (For odd spheres they are all <m>\mathbb{Z}</m>.)
          Let us look at the case where <m>X \in H_{k}(\Lambda;\mathbb{Z} )=\mathbb{Z}</m>.
          For each <m>m \in \mathbb{N}</m> there is a critical level
          <me>
            cr(mX)=\inf\{a:mX \in \text{ Image } H_{\ast}(\Lambda_{ a}M)\}
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If <m>j,m \in \mathbb{N}</m>,
          then clearly (since Image <m>H_{\ast}(\Lambda_{a})</m> is an additive subgroup of <m>H_{\ast}(\Lambda)</m>)
          <me>
            cr(jmX)\leq cr(mX)\text{.}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          But can there be strict inequality?
          Here is a little
          <q>example</q>
          to show how this would affect the global mean frequency : Suppose it were the case that there were real numbers <m>a\lt b\lt c\lt d</m> with
          <me>
            cr(mX)=\left\{ \begin{array}{c}d\text{ if } \gcd(m,3)=\gcd(m,7)=1\\ c\text{ if } 3|m\textit{ but }\gcd(m,7)=1\\ b\text{ if } 7|m\textit{ but }\gcd(m,3)=1\\ a\text{ if } 21|m \end{array} \right\}
