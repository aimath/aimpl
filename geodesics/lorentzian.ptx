  <title>Lorentzian metrics  and metrics of arbitrary signature</title>
  <subsection>
    <title>Closed geodesics</title>
    <p>
      Most of the questions we asked about the Riemannian and Finsler metric can be modified such that they are also interesting in the semi-Riemannian metrics (i.e.~of arbitrary signature) and in particular when the signature is Lorentzian.
      It appears though that the answers in the Lorentzian case are sometimes very different from those in the Riemannian case.
      Many methods that were effectively used in the Riemannian case,
      for example the variational methods,
      do not work in the case of general signature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us consider as an example the question analogous to the one we considered in Section 2:
      how many geometrically different closed geodesics must there be for a Lorenzian metric on a closed manifold.
    </p>
    <p>
      First let us note that there are two possible natural notions of closed geodesic in the Lorentzian setting:
      one may define a closed geodesic as an inmmersion
      <m>\gamma:S^1 \to M</m> such that <m>\nabla_{\dot \gamma} \dot \gamma=0</m>,
      or as a curve <m>\gamma:S^1 \to M</m> that can be locally reparameterized in such a way that it satisfies the equation <m>\nabla_{\dot \gamma} \dot \gamma=0</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Riemannian case, these definitions are essentially equivalent,
      since this reparameterization can always be made ``global''. If the signature is indefinite,
      it is easy to construct examples of an embedding
      <m>\gamma:S^1 \to M</m> such that locally <m>\gamma</m> can be reparameterized so that it becomes an affinely-parameterized geodesic,
      but globally such reparameterization is impossible:
      the velocity vector of the geodesic after returning to the same point is proportional but not equal to the initial velocity vector.
      Of course, this is possible only if the velocity vector is light-like.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will follow most publications and define a closed geodesic as an embedding
      <m>\gamma:S^1 \to M</m> such that <m>\nabla_{\dot \gamma} \dot \gamma=0</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the best of our knowledge,
      the existence of a closed geodesic on a Lorentzian manifold is a quite complicated problem and nothing is known in dimensions <m>\ge 3</m>.
      In dimension 2, a closed orientable manifold with a metric of signature <m>(+,-)</m> is homeomorphic to the torus.
      By \cite{Suhr2013a}, every Lorentzian 2-dimensional torus has at least two simple closed geodesics one of which is definite,
      i.e. timelike or spacelike.
      Moreover, explicit examples show the optimality of this claim.
    </p>
    <openquestion>
      <preamble>
        <p>
          We therefore ask the following
        </p>
      </preamble>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Does every closed Lorentzian manifold have at least one closed geodesic?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <discussion>
        <p>
          One of course can ask this question about manifolds of arbitrary signature and also about complete
          (note that in the Lorentzian setting there are many different non-equivalent notions of completeness)
          manifolds of finite volume.

        <p>
          See the introduction to the paper \cite{Fl-Ja-Pi2011} for a list of known results about the existence of closed time-like geodesics under additional assumptions.

    <title>Light-like geodesics of semi-Riemannian metrics</title>
    <p>
      Let <m>M</m> be a closed manifold with semi-Riemannian metric <m>g</m> of indefinite signature.
    </p>
    <openquestion xml:id="qst_ab">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Can there exist a complete semi-Riemannian metric <m>g</m> and a non-trivial 1-form <m>\eta</m> on a closed manifold such that for every light-like geodesic <m>\gamma(t)</m> the function
          <m>\eta(\dot\gamma(t))</m> grows linearly in both directions:
          i.e.~ for every light-like geodesic there exist
          <m>C_1 \neq 0, C_2</m> such that <m>\eta(\dot\gamma(t))= C_1\cdot t + C_2</m>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <status>
        <p>
          A negative answer to this question would give an easy proof of the semi-Riemannian version of the projective Lichnerowicz-Obata conjecture:
        </p>
      </status>
      <discussion>
        <p>
          Let a connected Lie group <m>G</m> act on a closed manifold
          (of dimension at least <m>2</m>)
          by projective transformations
          (diffeomorphisms that take geodesics to geodesics without necessarily preserving the parameterization).
          Then <m>G</m> acts by isometries,
          or <m>g</m> has constant sectional curvature.
        </p>
      </discussion>
      <status>
        <p>
          If <m>g</m> is Riemannian,
          the conjecture was proved in \cite{Matveev2005,Matveev2007}. For metrics of Lorentzian signature,
          the conjecture was proved in dimension 2 in \cite{Matveev2012b} and for all other dimensions in \cite{Bo-Ma-Ro2015}. The proof is complicated,
          and does not generalize for other signatures.
          In the semi-Riemannian case the following argument gives a proof for closed manifolds provided that the answer to the <xref ref="qst_ab">Question</xref> above is positive.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is known (see,
          for example, \cite{Matveev2007}) that a 1-form <m>\eta_i</m> generates a one-parameter group of projective transformations,
          if and only if
          <me>
            \eta_{i,jk}+ \eta_{j,ik} - \frac{2}{(n+1)} \eta^\ell_{\ ,\ell k} g_{ij}   = \lambda_i g_{jk} + \lambda_j g_{ik}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          (for a certain 1-form <m>\lambda_i</m>).
          We take a light line geodesic <m>\gamma(t)</m>,
          multiply the above equation by <m>\dot\gamma^i\dot\gamma^j\dot\gamma^k</m>
          (and sum with respect to repeating indexes)
          at every point <m>\gamma(t)</m> of the geodesic.
          The terms with the metric <m>g</m> disappear since <m>g_{ij} \dot\gamma^i\dot\gamma^j=0</m>,
          so we obtain the equation <m>\frac{d^2}{dt^2}\eta(\dot\gamma(t)) =0</m> implying that <m>\eta(\dot\gamma(t)) = t\cdot C_1 + C_2</m>.
          A negative answer to the question above implies that <m>C_1=0</m>.
          Hence <m>\eta(\dot\gamma(t))</m> is constant,
          which in turn implies that
          <m>\eta_{i,j}+ \eta_{j,i}</m> is proportional to <m>g_{ij}</m>.
          Then the covector field <m>\eta_i</m> generates a one-parameter group of conformal transformations.
          Finally, the proof of the conjecture follows from a classical observation of H. Weyl \cite{Weyl1921} that every transformation that is projective and conformal is a homothety.
        </p>
        <p>
          A version of the question above is whether,
          for a complete semi-Riemannian metric on a closed manifold <m>M</m>,
          the tangent vector of almost every geodesic remains in a bounded set of <m>TM</m>.
          A positive answer to this question immediately implies that the answer to the initial question is negative,
          thereby proving the projective Lichnerowicz-Obata conjecture on closed manifolds.

    <title>Completeness of closed manifolds of arbitrary signature (communicated by H. Baum)</title>
    <p>
      It is well-known that a closed Riemannian manifold is geodesically complete,
      in the sense that every geodesic
      <m>\gamma:(a,b)\to {M}</m> can be extended to a geodesic
      <m>\tilde \gamma:\mathbb{R} \to M</m> such that <m>\tilde \gamma|_{(a,b)}= \gamma</m>.
      It is also well known that for any indefinite signature there exist metrics on closed manifolds that are not geodesically complete.
    </p>
    <openquestion>
      <statement>
        <p>
          What geometric assumptions imply that a metric (possibly,
          of a fixed signature) on a closed manifold is geodesically complete?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <opinion>
        <p>
          We of course are interested in geometric assumptions that are easy to check or which are fulfilled for many interesting metrics.
        </p>
      </opinion>

        <p>
          Let us mention a few classical results.
          For compact homogeneous manifolds,
          geodesic completeness was established in \cite{Marsden1972}. For compact Lorentz manifolds of constant curvature geodesic completeness was proved in \cite{Carriere1989}
          (flat case)
          and \cite{Klingler1996}
          (general case).

      </status>
    </openquestion>
    <openquestion>
      <preamble>
        <p>
          We refer to the paper \cite{Sanchez2015} for a list of interesting results on this topic and for a list of open questions from which we repeat here only:
        </p>
      </preamble>
      <title>\cite{Sanchez2015}</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Assume that a compact Lorentzian manifold is globally conformal to a manifold of constant curvature.
          Must it be geodesically complete?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <suggestion>
        <p>
          Note also that in the non-compact case homogeneous manifolds of indefinite signature are not necessary geodesically complete;
          see for example \cite[Example 2 in \S 4]{Sanchez2015}. It is interesting to understand whether completeness of a homogeneous manifold can follow from algebraic properties of the isometry group.
