  <title>Closed geodesics</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Given a Riemannian manifold, does there exist a closed geodesic?
      If yes, how many
      (geometrically different)
      closed geodesics must exist?
      Existence is known if the manifold is closed.
      For surfaces
      (and certain manifolds of higher dimension, e.g.\ <m>S^n</m>),
      the result is essentially due to Birkhoff<nbsp/><xref ref="Birkhoff1927"/>.
      He used two arguments.
      The first is a variational argument in the free loop space <m>\Lambda M</m>.
      From the subspace of <m>\Lambda M</m> consisting of all loops homotopic to a given loop,
      one selects a sequence of loops whose lengths converge to the infimum of the length function on the subspace.
      If the loops from this sequence lie in a compact region of the manifold
      (for example, if the manifold itself is compact),
      then by the Arzel\`a-Ascoli theorem there exists a loop where the infimum is achieved;
      if the infimum is not zero,
      this loop is automatically a non-trivial closed geodesic.
      These arguments show the existence of closed geodesics in many cases,
      in particular for compact manifolds with non-trivial fundamental group.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the infimum of the length of the loops homotopic to a given loop is zero, Birkhoff suggested another procedure (actually,
      a trick) to prove the existence of closed geodesics,
      which is explained for example in<nbsp/><xref ref="Birkhoff1927"/>.
      This trick is nowadays called the \knownterminology{Birkhoff minimax procedure}, and was used for example to show the existence of closed geodesics on any Riemannian sphere with dimension <m>\ge 2</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us recall this procedure in the simplest case,
      when the manifold is <m>S^2</m>.
      We consider the foliation of the sphere without two points
      (north and south poles)
      as in the picture:
      if we think of the standard embedding in <m>\Real^3</m>,
      the fibers are the intersections of the sphere with the planes <m>\{x_3=\mathrm{const}\}</m>.
    </p>
    <sidebyside>
      {<image width="70%" source="images/birkhoff.png"/> }
    </sidebyside>
    <p>
      Now apply a curve shortening procedure to every curve of this foliation,
      there are many options for such a procedure.
      We need that the evolution of the curves in this procedure depends continuously on the curve.
      We obtain a sequence <m>F_i</m> of the foliations of the sphere without two points into curves.
      For each foliation <m>F_i</m> of the sequence,
      let <m>\gamma_i</m> be a leaf of maximal length.
      Because of topology, the lengths of the circles
      <m>\gamma_i</m> are bounded from below by a certain positive number.
      By the Arzel\`a-Ascoli theorem,
      the sequence of curves <m>\gamma_i</m> has a convergent subsequence.
      The limit of this subsequence is a stable point of the shortening procedure,
      and is therefore a geodesic.
    </p>
    <p>
      For arbitrary closed manifolds,
      the existence of a closed geodesic is due to Lyusternik and Fet (\cite{Lyu-Fet1951} and<nbsp/><xref ref="Fet1952"/>).
      They considered the energy functional on the loop space
      <m>\Lambda M</m> and showed that the topology of
      <m>\Lambda M</m> is complicated enough so that the energy functional must have critical points with non-zero energy
      (which are non-trivial closed geodesics).
      Lyusternik and Schnirelmann<nbsp/><xref ref="Lyu-Sch1929a"/> and<nbsp/><xref ref="Lyu-Sch1929b"/> had earlier used a related argument to show that any Riemannian metric on <m>S^2</m> has at least <m>3</m> simple closed geodesics.
    </p>
    <p>
      How many closed geodesics must exist on a closed manifold?
      For surfaces, the answer is known:
      there are always infinitely many geometrically different closed geodesics.
      This is easily proved using Birkhoff's first argument when the fundamantal group is infinite.
      The remaining cases of the sphere and the projective plane were settled by<nbsp/><xref ref="Bangert1993"/> and<nbsp/><xref ref="Franks1992"/>.
      In higher dimensions Rademacher has shown that a closed manifold with a generic Riemannian metric admits infinitely many geometrically different closed geodesics<nbsp/><xref ref="Rademacher1989"/>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main approach to proving the existence of infinitely many closed geodesics has been to apply Morse theory to the energy functional on the free loop space <m>\Lambda M</m>.
      The critical points of this functional are precisely the closed geodesics.
      But it has to be remembered that each closed geodesic can be traversed an arbitrary number of times.
      It is thus important to distinguish geometrically different geodesics from repetitions of the same geodesic.
      This distinction is difficult to make and so far,
      despite some published claims,
      the existence of infinitely many closed geodesics on a general compact Riemannian manifold has not been proven.
      Nor have the resources of the Morse theory approach been fully exhausted.

      One can modify these classical questions in different directions;
      this will be done below.

    <title>Riemannian metrics on spheres</title>
    <p>
      Except in dimension 2, all that is currently known for a general Riemannian metric on a sphere are the results that hold for all compact Riemannian manifolds.
      <em>Is there an extension of Lyusternik and Schnirelmann's result to higher dimensions,
      in particular to <m>S^3</m></em>?

    <title>Finsler metrics on <m>S^2</m></title>
    <p>
      The arguments of Fet
      (and Morse)
      can be adapted to the Finsler setting:
      one can show the existence of at least one closed geodesic on every compact manifold.
      Moreover, if the Finsler metric is reversible,
      or if the manifold is a surface other than the sphere or the projective plane,
      one can show the existence of infinitely many geometrically different closed geodesics.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following example constructed in<nbsp/><xref ref="Katok1973"/> shows that the number of closed geodesics on a 2-sphere with an irreversible metric can be~<m>2</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider the sphere <m>S^2</m> with the standard metric <m>g_0</m> of constant curvature <m>1</m> and the Killing field <m>V</m> induced by the one parameter group of rotations about the north and south poles.
      Define a one parameter family of functions on <m>T^*M</m> by
      <me>
        F_\alpha(\xi) = \sqrt{g^*_0(\xi,\xi)} + \alpha \xi(V)
      </me>,
      where <m>g^*_0</m> is the dual metric of <m>g_0</m>.
      For small enough <m>\alpha \in \mathbb R</m> there is a Randers Finsler metric,
      <m>F_\alpha</m> such that
      <me>
        \|v\|_\alpha = F_\alpha \circ L^{-1}_\alpha(v)
      </me>,
      where <m>L_\alpha: T^*M \to T^M</m> is the Legendre transformation induced by the function <m>\frac12 F^2_\alpha</m>.
      If <m>V</m> is scaled so that its integral curves have the same period as the geodesics of <m>g_0</m>,
      then <m>g_\alpha</m> has precisely two closed geodesics for each irrational <m>\alpha</m>.
      They are the equator
      (the unique great circle tangent to <m>V</m>)
      traversed in both directions.
      See<nbsp/><xref ref="Ziller1982"/> and<nbsp/><xref ref="Rademacher2004"/> for more details.
    </p>
    <p>
      This example can be generalized to higher dimensions:
      one obtains a Finsler metric on <m>S^n</m> with precisely
      <m>2[(n+1)/2]</m> distinct prime closed geodesics;
      see<nbsp/><xref ref="Katok1973"/>.
    </p>
    <p>
      V.~Bangert and Y.~Long in<nbsp/><xref ref="Ban-Lon2010"/> and<nbsp/><xref ref="Long2006"/> proved that there are always at least 2 distinct prime closed geodesics for every irreversible Finsler metric on <m>S^2</m>.

      </statement>
      <context>
        <p>
          There exist results supporting this conjecture.
          In particular, H.~Hofer, K.~Wysocki and E.~Zehnder in<nbsp/><xref ref="Ho-Wy-Ze2003"/> studied Reeb orbits on contact <m>S^3</m>.
          Their result can be projected down to <m>S^2</m>,
          and implies that the total number of distinct prime closed geodesics for a bumpy Finsler metric on <m>S^2</m> is either 2 or infinite,
          provided the stable and unstable manifolds of every hyperbolic closed geodesics intersect transversally.

          The existence of one hyperbolic prime closed geodesic on a Finsler <m>S^2</m> implies the existence of infinitely many distinct prime closed geodesics.

      </statement>
      <context>
        <p>
          The conjecture agrees with a result of Y.~Long and W.~Wang who proved that there are always at least 2 elliptic prime closed geodesics on every irreversible Finsler <m>S^2</m>,
          if the total number of prime closed geodesics is finite~<nbsp/><xref ref="Lon-Wan2008"/>.
          The conjecture does not contradict<nbsp/><xref ref="Grjuntal1979"/> where an example of a metric such that all closed simple geodesics are hyperbolic is constructed.
          Indeed, for certain metrics on the sphere
          (and even for the metric of certain ellipsoids)
          most prime closed geodesics are not simple.

    <title>Of complete Riemannian metrics  with finite volume</title>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Does every complete Riemannian manifold with finite volume have at least one closed geodesic?

        <p>
          The question was answered affirmatively for dimension 2.
          Moreover, in dimension 2 a complete Riemannian manifold of finite volume even has infinitely many geometrically different geodesics<nbsp/><xref ref="Bangert1980"/>.
          The argument that was used in the proof is based on the Birkhoff minimax procedure we recalled in the beginning of <xref ref="closed_geodesics">\S</xref>,
          and does not work in dimensions <m>\ge 3</m>.
          One can even hope to construct counterexamples in the class of Liouville-integrable geodesic flows.
          In this case,
          most orbits of the geodesic flow are rational or irrational windings on the Liouville tori;
          they are closed,
          if all of the corresponding frequencies are rational.
          Since there are essentially <m>(n-1)</m> frequencies in dimension <m>n</m>,
          one can hope that if <m>n > 2</m> it would be possible to ensure that there is always at least one irrational frequency.
          Initial attempts to find a counterexample on
          <m>T^2\times \Real</m> with the metric of the form
          <m>a(r)d\phi^2 + b(r) d\psi^2+ dr^2</m> were, however,
          unsuccessful.
        </p>
        <p>
          A more difficult problem would be to prove that on any complete Riemannian manifold of finite volume there exist infinitely many closed geodesics.

    <openquestion>
      <preamble>
        <p>
          Questions of this nature are also interesting in the realm of Finsler geometry.
          One would expect the results for reversible Finsler metrics to be very similar to those for Riemannian metrics.
          For irreversible Finsler metrics, Katok's example shows that there are compact Finsler manifolds with only finitely many closed geodesics,
          but it is still possible that all non-compact Finsler manifolds with finite volume might have infinitely many closed geodesics.
          On the other hand, the following question is completely open:

    <title>Of  magnetic flows  on closed surfaces</title>
    <p>
      It is known that the trajectory of a charged particle in the presence of magnetic forces (=``magnetic geodesic'') is described by a Hamiltonian system with the ``kinetic'' Hamiltonian of the form
      <m>\sum_{i,j} p_ip_jg^{ij}</m> on <m>T^*M</m> with the symplectic form <m>dp\wedge dx +\pi^* \omega</m>,
      where <m>\omega</m> is a closed
      (but not necessarily exact)
      form on <m>M</m> and <m>\pi:T^*M\to M</m> is the canonical projection.

        <p>
          The only known case in which the answer is negative is when <m>\omega</m> is the area form for a hyperbolic surface and the magnetic flow is the horocycle flow.
          On the other hand Ginzburg showed that there is always a closed orbit if the magnetic field is weak enough<nbsp/>[<a knowl="Ginzburg1989.knowl">Ginzburg1989</a>,

        </p>
        <p>
          If <m>\omega</m> is exact,
          the affirmative answer for all closed orientable surfaces and all energy levels was obtained in<nbsp/><xref ref="Co-Ma-Pa2004"/>,
          which is partially based on<nbsp/><xref ref="Taimanov1992"/>.
          Actually, by<nbsp/>[<a knowl="Ab-Ma-Pa2015.knowl">Ab-Ma-Pa2015</a>,
          <a knowl="AMMP2017.knowl">AMMP2017</a>], in this case there are at least two closed geodesics on almost every energy level.

          If the energy is greater than Ma\~n\'e's critical value <m>c_u</m>,
          then the magnetic flow is conjugate to a Finsler geodesic flow,
          which has <m>\geq 2</m> closed orbits in the case of <m>S^2</m> (by<nbsp/><xref ref="Ban-Lon2010"/>) and infinitely many closed orbits if the genus of the surface is positive
          (at least two for each free homotopy class).
          The lower bound of 2 is sharp because of the Katok example mentioned above.

        <p>
          For energy less than <m>c_u</m>,
          the results about more than one closed geodesic are only for almost every energy level.
          Contreras obtained at least 2 closed geodesics<nbsp/><xref ref="Contreras2006"/>.
          In<nbsp/><xref ref="Ab-Ma-Pa2015"/> this was improved to at least 3, and in fact infinitely many under a non-degeneracy assumption,
          which was removed in<nbsp/><xref ref="AMMP2017"/>.

          In the case of magnetic monopoles (i.e.\ when <m>\omega</m> is not exact),
          the answer is affirmative if the energy level is contact;
          this is an immediate corollary of the proof of the Weinstein conjecture in dimension 3 by Taubes<nbsp/><xref ref="Taubes2007"/>.
          On the other hand, Benedetti has given examples of magnetic monopoles on <m>S^2</m> with energy levels that are not contact;
          see Proposition 4.9 in<nbsp/><xref ref="Benedetti2016"/>.
          On <m>S^2</m>, if the form <m>\omega</m> is nowhere vanishing,
          the existence of a closed magnetic geodesic on sufficiently big energy level is established in<nbsp/><xref ref="Ass-Ben2016"/>;

    <title>Kropina metrics with  nonintegrable distribution</title>
    <p>
      A Kropina metric on a Riemannian manifold <m>(M,g)</m> is the function on the tangent bundle given by <m>F(\xi)= \tfrac{g(\xi, \xi)}{\omega(\xi)}</m>,
      where <m>\omega</m> is a nowhere vanishing 1-form.
      We will assume that <m>\omega\wedge d\omega</m> nowhere vanishes;
      this assumption implies that the distribution <m>\textrm{Ker} (\omega)</m> is not integrable.
      A Kropina metric is not a Finsler metric,
      since it is not defined on the kernel of <m>\omega</m>,
      but still the function <m>F</m> is one-homogeneous and strictly convex at <m>\xi\not\in \textrm{Ker} (\omega)</m>;
      one can use it to define the distance on <m>M</m> and geodesics on <m>M</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recent interest in Kropina metrics is due to their relations to the so-called chains in CR geometry,
