  <title>Delone Sets</title>
  <p>
    A Delone set is a subset of <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m> satisfying the following properties: There exists a pair of positive constants <m>(r,R)</m> such that every ball of radius r contains at most one point of <m>X</m> and ever ball of radius <m>R</m> contains at least one point of <m>X</m>.

    <p>
      The notion of a skeletal complex can be naturally extended to Delone sets.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Study skeletal complexes based on Delone sets.

      <p>
        For <m>d \ge 4</m>, given a Delone set <m>(R,r)</m> for which all <m>2R</m>- clusters are pairwise congruent, find upper bound on the order of the symmetry group of the clusters which does not depend on <m>R/r</m>.

    <p>
      In 3 dimensions, it is known that if all <m>10R</m> clusters are equivalent, the Delone set is regular.
    </p>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Can this result be improved for <m>\rho \lt 10R</m>, e.g. <m>\rho = 4R</m>?  Is it possible to show similar results for full dimensional <m>r</m>-sets with conditions weaker than the <m>R</m> condition?
